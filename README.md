## Things I was unable to finish

I was unable to finish the mobile view. I would have checked the window.matchMedia('(max-width: 600px)')
if the media query matched I would have conditionally rendered the mobile view. I was really focused on
semantic HTML. Typically I would have used a div or other non semantic element and used css grid for the table but I wanted to use a table so that it would meet the semantic HTML requirement. I could quite get the design
pixel perfect like I wanted to. I would go back and take more time on the css to get it to make the design better.
